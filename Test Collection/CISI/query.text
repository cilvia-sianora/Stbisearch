NDX-100:  An Electronic Filing Machine for the Office of the Future

Slonim, J.
MacRae, L.J.

Diamond, N.
.W
    This paper describes the design and implementation of an "electronic filing
machine," a machine which is capable of storing large numbers of "unstructured"
documents in such a way a particular document may be easily and quickly 
retrieved.  A functional distributed architecture permits the implementation
of the system in a mixture of hardware and software.

The Selection of Good Search Terms

van Rijsbergen, C.J.
Harper, D.J.
Porter, M.F.
.W
    This paper tackles the problem of how one might select further search terms,
using relevance feedback, given the search terms in the query.  These search
terms are extracted from a maximum spanning tree connecting all the terms in the
index term vocabulary.  A number of different spanning trees are generated from
a variety of association measures.  The retrieval effectiveness for the  
different spanning trees is shown to be approximately the same.  Effectiveness
is measured in terms of precision and recall, and the retrieval tests are done
on three different test collections.

Indexing Consistency, Quality and Efficiency
.A
Rolling, L.
.W
    Indexing quality determines whether the information content of an indexed
document is accurately represented.  Indexing effectiveness measures whether
an indexed document is correctly retrieved every time it is relevant to a 
query.  Measurement of these criteria is cumbersome and costly; data base
producers therefore prefer inter-indexer consistency as a measure of indexing
quality or effectiveness.  The present article assesses the validity of this
substitution in various environments.

Text Passage Retrieval Based on Colon Classification:  Retrieval Performance
.A
Shepherd, M.A.
.W
    A set of experiments was conducted to determine the suitability of the
Colon Classification as a foundation for the automated analysis, representation
and retrieval of primary information from the full text of documents.  Primary
information is that information embodied in the text of a document, as opposed
to secondary information which is generally in such forms as:  an abstract, a 
table of contents, or an index.
    Full text databases were created in two subject areas and queries solicited
from specialists in each area.  An automated full text indexing system, along
with four automated passage retrieval systems, was created to test the various
features of the Colon Classification.  Two Boolean-based systems and one simple
word occurrence system were created in order to compare the retrieval results
against types of systems which are in more common use.  The systems' retrieval
performances were measured using recall and precision and the mean expected
search length reduction factors.
    Overall, it was found that the Colon Classification-based systems did not 
perform significantly better than the other systems.

User-Responsive Subject Control in Bibliographic Retrieval Systems
.A
Tague, J.M.
.W
    A study was carried out of the relationship between the vocabulary of
user queries and the vocabulary of documents relevant to the queries, and
the value of adding to the document description record in a retrieval system
keywords from previous queries for which the document had proved useful.
Two test databases incorporating user query keywords were implemented at
the School of Library and Information Science, University of Western
Ontario.  Clustering of the documents via title and user keywords, a
statistical analysis of title-user keyword co-occurrences, and retrieval
tests were used to examine the effect of the added keywords.  Results
showed the impracticality of the procedure in an operational setting, but
indicated the value of analyses with sample data in the development and
maintenance of keyword dictionaries and thesauri.

A Program for Machine-Mediated Searching
.A
Toliver, D.
.W
    A technique of online instruction and assistance to bibliographic data
base searchers called Individualized Instruction for Data Access (IIDA) is
being developed by Drexel University.  IIDA assists searchers by providing
feedback based on real-time analysis while searches are being performed.  
Extensive help facilities which draw on this analysis are available to
users.  Much of the project's experimental work, as described elsewhere,
is concerned with the process of searching and the behavior of searchers.
This paper will largely address itself to the project's computer system, which
is being developed by subcontract with the Franklin Institute's Science
Information Services.

Author Cocitation:  A Literature Measure of Intellectual Structure
.A
White, H.D.
Griffith, B.C.
.W
    It is shown that the mapping of a particular area of science, in this
case information science, can be done using authors as units of analysis and
the cocitations of pairs of authors as the variable that indicates their
"distances" from each other.  The analysis assumes that the more two authors
are cited together, the closer the relationship between them.  The raw data
are cocitation counts drawn online from Social Scisearch (Social Sciences 
Citation Index) over the period 1972-1979.  GThe resulting map shows 
(1) identifiable author groups (akin to "schools") of information science,
(2) locations of these groups with respect to each other, (3) the degree of
centrality and peripherality of authors within groups, (4) proximities of
authors within group and across group boundaries ("border authors" who seem
to connect various areas of research), and (5) positions of authors with
respect to the map's axes, which were arbitrarily set spanning the most
divergent groups in order to aid interpretation.  Cocitation analysis of
authors offers a new technique that might contribute to the understanding of
intellectual structure in the sciences and possibly in other areas to the
extent that those areas rely on serial publications.  The technique
establishes authors, as well as documents, as an effective unit in 
analyzing subject specialties.

Progress in Documentation.  Word Processing:  
An Introduction and Appraisal
.A
Whitehead, J.
.W
    The "Office of the Future," "Office Technology," "Word Processing,"
"Electronic Mail," "Electronic Communications," "Convergence," "Information
Management."  These are all terms included in the current list of buzz words
used to describe current activities in the office technology area.  The high
level of investment in factories and plants and the ever-increasing fight to
improve productivity by automating the dull, routine jobs are usually quoted 
and compared with the extremely low investment in improving and automating
the equally tedious routine jobs in the office environment; the investment
in the factory is quoted as being ten times greater per employee than in the
office.  This, however, is changing rapidly and investment on a large scale
is already taking place in manhy areas as present-day inflation bites hard, 
forcing many companies and organizations to take a much closer look at their
office operations.

Document Clustering Using an Inverted File Approach
.A
Willett, P.
.W
    An automated document clustering procedure is described which does not
require the use of an inter-document similarity matrix and which is independent
of the order in which the documents are processed.  The procedure makes use of
an initial set of clusters which is derived from certain of the terms in the
indexing vocabulary used to characterise the documents in the file.  The 
retrieval effectiveness obtained using the clustered file is compared with that 
obtained from serial searching and from use of the single-linkage clustering
method.

A Fast Procedure for the Calculation of Similarity Coefficients in
in Automatic Classification
.A
Willett, P.
.W
    A fast algorithm is described for comparing the lists of terms representing
documents in automatic classification experiments.  The speed of the procedure
arises from the fact that all of the non-zero-valued coefficicents for a given
document are identified together, using an inverted file to the terms in the
document collection.  The complexity and running time of the algorithm are
compared with previously described procedures.
